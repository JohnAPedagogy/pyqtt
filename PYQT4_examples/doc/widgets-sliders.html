<p>Qt provides three types of slider-like widgets: <font color='#eeeeee'>QSlider</font>, <font color='#eeeeee'>QScrollBar</font> and <font color='#eeeeee'>QDial</font>. They all inherit most of their functionality from <font color='#eeeeee'>QAbstractSlider</font>, and can in theory replace each other in an application since the differences only concern their look and feel. This example shows what they look like, how they work and how their behavior and appearance can be manipulated through their properties.</p>
